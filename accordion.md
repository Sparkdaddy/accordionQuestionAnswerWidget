# Accordion steps to build

* Do more research into seeing if there is a component/widget out there that behaves like this (0.5 more hours)

## Build from scratch path
* ~~Validate that the json is correct~~
* ~~Previous choices should go back to that choice (add click option)~~
* ~~If there is no other option then display the end result~~
* ~~Clicking an option should get the index of that choice and put that up onto the screen~~
* ~~Add timed translations via css clicks of options~~
* ~~Alternate colors for every other element~~
* Make the widget mobile friendly and reactive
* Make a self-referential option possible (version 2)
