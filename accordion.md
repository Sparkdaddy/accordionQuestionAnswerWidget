# Accordion steps to build

* Do more research into seeing if there is a component/widget out there that behaves like this (0.5 more hours)

## Build from scratch path
* Validate that the json is correct
* Add timed translations via css clicks of options
* Previous choices should go back to that choice (add click option)
* Clicking an option should get the index of that choice and put that up onto the screen
* If there is no other option then display the end result
* Make the widget mobile friendly and reactive

I think this may take me 12 hours to build and properly test that it is working. Net change of 6 added hours. Would you like to bill it at a continuation of the hourly rate before? The difference with a small buffer of 2 additional hours for a maximum of 8 more hours.
